        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When life gives you lemons, make the Best Lemonade Ever! This aptly named recipe is as good as it gets: Sweet, tart, easy to throw together, and oh-so refreshing.</p>   
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>Ice</li>
            <li>Lemons</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by firmly rolling the lemons around on the counter. This will help release the juices and make your job a lot easier. Cut the lemon in half lengthwise, then squeeze out the juice by hand or with a juicer. Make sure to juice the lemons over a large measuring cup so you can see exactly how much liquid you have.</li> 
            <li>It's shockingly simple to make simple syrup on the stove. Just combine sugar and water in a small saucepan, bring the mixture to a boil, and stir it until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li>SPour cold water into a pitcher. Stir in lemon juice and pulp, then add simple syrup to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve over ice. If you're feeling fancy, garnish each glass with a fresh lemon slice.</li>
        </ol>
